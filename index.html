            <p>Fox are great pets to have since they're related to dogs, learn quickly like dogs, they know how to be loyal to owners that treat them good.
            the only thing for them is their meal, because unlike other dogs, their meal is very specific and some of them is even live mice (eww).
            These pets are considered as a wild animal. so some people might not want to be near foxes, but for others it might be cool to see one and meet them and pet it.</p>

            <p>Some people either hate snakes or a fear of snakes. But having a pet snake however is pretty cool to have one as your own. because people will be attracted to your snake.
            though getting a snake in the first place maybe hard to tame but in the end its very cute to have one.</p>

            <p>Cats are great pets to own. because they have affection for their owners.
             they're playful and entertaining to watch them fail. but their hair will be everywhere because they shed their hair often, and
              unlike other animals claw they have sharp claws and when it comes out of nowhere they're painfull to get hurt by one.
              also keep them in a constant watch, because they'll poop and piss around your house without you even knowing.</p>

            <p>a specific dog breeds that are great in homes to own one. they are loving and affectionate dogs with people that knows how to interact with them.
            but for young children should be kept away, since most young children doesn't know how to interact with Jack Russell. though very loyal to their owners,
            they can snap and hurt others if you handle them improperly.</p>

            <img src="http://onzinearticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Pet-Parrot.png">
            <p>Parrots are very cool to own one since these birds are very intelligent and very rewarding to have one when it trust you.
            they're really beautiful pets to have one and since their smart they have a personality and it all depends on you as an owner.
            A bond between birds and humans are really awesome to see and rewarding when it find you trustworthy as an owner.
            though some Parrots may never talk, they can scream and change on their tone through dawn and dusk. having it watched by kids tend to not cooperate with them.
            Since like most toddlers, don't know how to handle a pet correctly and could possibly bite them.</p>
